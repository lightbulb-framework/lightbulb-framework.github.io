This year, on BSides Athens, we will introduce a new and efficient graphical interface for the lightbulb framework, directly integrated to the Burp Proxy Suite. 

The extension is designed to assist the penetration tester throughout the step of information gathering and black box penetration testing of unknown WAFs and complex filters. The new automata learning backed payload processor is a game changer that obsoletes the existing Intruder payloads and increases the overall chances of a successful evasion attack. The graphical interface allows easily access to an extendable library of WAF filters and injection attacks, and offers support for advanced rule based fingerprinting of popular open source WAFs.
